description: It's nobody's fault, but our democracy is fucked.
---

When the Constitution was written, democracy was an immature concept.
There was no precedent to look to; European powers were monarchies, and
the rest of the world was broken into colonies. So the framers studied
endlessly, debated fiercely, and put together perhaps the most
revolutionary document of all time.

But even the greatest minds of the 18th century could not have
anticipated how much the world would change. Advances in agriculture,
communication, energy, and transportation allow New York City to support
a population of 8.5M people; that's more than double the population of
the entire United States at the 1790 census. When Adams ran against
Jefferson in 1796[^1], the total vote count was well under 100k, and all
votes were cast by rich white men. For every voter then, there are over
a thousand voters now, and the electorate is immeasurably more diverse.

[^1]: The election of 1796 was the first "real" election in US history, since George Washington was unopposed in 1988 and 1792.

The system wasn't built to handle numbers like these, and it shows. It's
nobody's fault, but our democracy is fucked.

The founders were famously hostile to the dominance of political
parties. However, they also chose for presidents to be elected using
first-past-the-post voting, which makes a two-party system inevitable. A
strong third candidate can only ever split the vote. When the Democrats
did not unify in 1860, Republicans won; when Republicans did not unify
in 1912, Democrats won.

Historically, the two-party system worked because information access was
slow. People elected their representatives, based on a broad
understanding of their priorities, their values, and their experience.
Those representatives would take the time to read, write, and understand
proposed legislation. They would meet in smoke-filled rooms and find
common ground across party lines. That's how we got Social Security,
Medicare, Civil Rights, Glass-Steagal, and so on. The Interstate Highway
Act, among the most impactful pieces of legislation of the 20th century,
was even passed by a divided government.

Now, information access is fast. In the space of a few minutes, it's
possible to go from not knowing about an issue, to reading a few
articles about it within an echo chamber, to picking a fight with a
stranger online. 

Candidates are no longer allowed to find compromise behind closed doors;
they lay out policy positions during the primaries, and are expected to
hold firm on those positions. Those who waver -- who seek out common
ground with the other party -- quickly find themselves out of a job. 

Democracy only works as long as representatives act in good faith, with
the ultimate goal of addressing the problems that face the country. But
when the public has the ability to micromanage its elected officials,
those officials find themselves pressured to act in bad faith, in order
to prove their ideological purity. Political points are scored by
fighting dirty: shutting down the government, refusing to consider
executive appointments, and voting dozens of times to repeal the
signature accomplishment of the sitting president.

**low-information voters...**

In a sense, the representative nature of our democracy is breaking down,
giving way to a direct democracy. The problem is, direct democracy
doesn't work. Despite having strong opinions, the public doesn't have
the time, interest, or expertise to run the country. 

For example, consider a pair of
[2016 San Francisco ballot measures](https://ballotpedia.org/San_Francisco_City_and_County,_California_ballot_measures),
Prop J and Prop K. Prop J, which passed easily, proposed to set aside
$150M per year for homelessness; Prop K, a sales tax to fund the
measure, was soundly defeated. As the saying goes, "if you're
explaining, you're losing." It's easy to rally support for simple,
good-sounding policies. But when it comes to the nuts and bolts of
making it work, it's a lot easier to poison a proposal than it is to
convince a non-expert of its value.

Never has our democracy felt so direct -- that is, disfunctional -- as
it did during Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential run. The populist tone
of the primaries forced her to abandon her
[Pacific Rim trade agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership),
despite the fact that most voters knew nothing substantial about it[^2].
Half of the Democratic base complained that her proposed education
spending was too ambitious, while the other half complained that it
fell short of what her opponent in the primaries had promised. She was
dogged by complaints that her racial justice positions weren't forceful
enough, and also that she did too little to court blue-collar whites,
who are turned off by identity politics. In the end, too much of her
voter base saw her as a compromise, and she lost. 

[^2]: TPP was among the most absurd criticisms of Clinton's platform. It was attacked not for its actual contents, but as a stand-in for the political establishment. Throughout the 20th century, trade agreements enjoyed broad support from politicians of both parties, as well as from economists -- even in cases where free trade is problematic, protectionism is worse. It remains to be seen what will happen if other Pacific Rim nations choose to enact [RCEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Comprehensive_Economic_Partnership) instead.

Donald Trump, on the other hand, sidestepped this issue by refusing to
articulate his positions. He echoed iconic Republican talking points
when convenient -- low taxes, gun rights, law and order -- but became
evasive when pressed for details. His signature issue, a wall on the
Mexican border, is more bravado than policy. He won by leveraging his
personality: he held huge rallies, picked fights on Twitter, and
dominated the media coverage.

If we're surprised that the charismatic candidate beat the
policy-focused candidate, we shouldn't be; it happens every time.
Obama's campaigns were built on his powerful oratory skills. GWB ran as
the candidate you'd like to have a beer with. In the past four decades,
1988 is the only presidential election in which the winner (GHWB) could
reasonably be described as "smart but boring."

In fact, in the modern era, it's actually the Democrats who seem to be
more reliant in the charisma of their presidential candidates. JFK,
Carter, Bill Clinton, and Obama were famously charismatic, and inspired
high voter turnout. The same cannot be said of Mondale, Dukakis, Gore,
and Kerry. Perhaps this is because of the breadth of the Democratic
voter base -- a personlity-focused campaign may help distract from the
disparate policy priorities of LGBT voters, young voters, and voters of
color[^3].

[^3]: One might naively imagine that people of color and LGBT people, both historically-marginalized groups, would easily find common ground. The reality is more complicated. For example, nearly 60% of Americans approve of same-sex marriage, but [approval among Black Protestants is only 40%](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/05/12/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/). 

Republican voter turnout is not nearly so volatile; in each of the past
four elections, the Republican presidential nominee has received more or
less the same number of votes.

There is a trope of blaming bad outcomes on low-information voters, but perhaps high-information voters are even worse. So-called low-information voters trust their elected officials to represent them in good faith. High-information voters instead demand their representatives take specific, extreme, bridge-burning actions. 

How does negative campaigning fit into this?

Hunger for more information. 




There is a trope of blaming bad outcomes on low-information voters -- voters who take candidates at their word, and are oblivious to dishonesty and nepotism. But high-information voters may be even worse. It's high-information voters who make specific demands of their elected officials, 

who demand that representatives adide by the letter of their promises



Low-information voters take candidates at their word; they are at times oblivious to dishonesty and nepotism.

People don't understand the government. This isn't to knock the public as ignorant -- the system is huge and archaic and complex. 

Look at the makeup of the federal legislature versus the makeup of state legislatures. They track each other closely. This suggests that people vote per their partisan identity, not based on an understanding of what they're voting for.

> That’s the good news for incumbents everywhere. Here’s the bad: if more than half of voters don’t know who runs the statehouse, then those same voters also don’t know whom to reward (or to blame). The best place to see this is in the research of Steven Rogers, a political scientist at St. Louis University who specializes in state legislatures. Rogers has analyzed decades of data across dozens of states. He’s tested various factors to see how they might influence voters: the state’s economy, tax rates, homicide rate and student reading scores, among others. What Rogers has found is that these measures have little or no effect on whether a state legislator wins re-election. Instead, state races correlate largely with presidential politics — whether the voter approves of the president and whether the legislator belongs to the president’s party. Crafting great (or terrible) legislation on jobs or criminal sentencing doesn’t seem to matter. "Whether or not state legislators are elected," Rogers said, "has very little to do with them."

For a sobering perspective on the public's knowledge of the political
process, we can look to a figure from FiveThirtyEight's Craig Fehrman:
