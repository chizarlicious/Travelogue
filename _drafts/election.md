When the Constitution was written, democracy was an immature concept. There was no precedent to look to; European powers were monarchies, and the rest of the world was broken into colonies. So the framers studied endlessly, debated fiercely, and put together perhaps the most revolutionary document of all time.

But even the greatest minds of the 18th century could not have anticipated how much the world would change. Advances in agriculture, communication, energy, and transportation allow New York City to support a population of 8.5M people; that's more than double the population of the entire United States at the 1790 census. When Adams ran against Jefferson in 1796[^1], the total vote count was well under 100k, and all
votes were cast by rich white men. For every voter then, there are over a thousand voters now, and the electorate is immeasurably more diverse.

[^1]: The election of 1796 was the first "real" election in US history, since George Washington ran unopposed in 1988 and 1792.

The system wasn't built to handle numbers like these, and it shows. It's nobody's fault, but our democracy is fucked.

The founders were famously hostile to the dominance of political parties. However, they also chose for presidents to be elected using first-past-the-post voting, which makes a two-party system inevitable. A strong third candidate can only ever split the vote. When the Democrats did not unify in 1860, Republicans won; when Republicans did not unify in 1912, Democrats won.

Historically, the two-party system worked because information access was slow. People elected their representatives, based on a broad understanding of their priorities, their values, and their experience. Those representatives would take the time to read, write, and understand proposed legislation. They would meet in smoke-filled rooms and find common ground across party lines. That's how we got Social Security, Medicare, Civil Rights, Glass-Steagal, and so on. The Interstate Highway Act, among the most impactful pieces of legislation of the 20th century, was even passed by a divided government.

Now, information access is fast. In the space of a few minutes, it's possible to go from not knowing about an issue, to reading a few articles about it within an echo chamber, to picking a fight with a stranger online. Compromises are made by the primary electorate rather than by the legislators; candidates are chosen based on policy positions, and are expected to stand firm on those positions. Those who waver -- who seek out common ground with the other party -- quickly find themselves out of a job.

Democracy only works as long as representatives act in good faith; their ultimate goal must be to address the problems facing the country. In a polarized environment, representatives are under constant pressure to act in bad faith, in order to prove their ideological purity. Political points are scored by fighting dirty: shutting down the government, refusing to consider executive appointments, and voting dozens of times to repeal the signature accomplishment of the sitting president.

In a sense, the representative nature of our democracy is breaking down, giving way to a direct democracy. The problem is, direct democracy doesn't work. Despite having strong opinions, the public doesn't have the time, interest, or expertise to run the country. As an example, consider a pair of [2016 San Francisco ballot measures](https://ballotpedia.org/San_Francisco_City_and_County,_California_ballot_measures): Prop J, which proposed to set aside $150M per year for homelessness, passed easily; Prop K, a sales tax increase to raise the funds for Prop J, was soundly defeated. 

And as the saying goes, "if you're explaining, you're losing." It's easy to rally support for simple, good-sounding policies. But when it comes to the nuts and bolts of making it work, it's a lot easier to poison a proposal than it is to convince a non-expert of its merits.

This breakdown was particularly clear in Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential run. The populist tone of the primaries forced her to abandon [TPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership), a Pacific Rim trade agreement[^2], despite the fact that most voters knew nothing substantial about it. Half of the Democratic base complained that her proposed education spending was too ambitious, while the other half thought it wasn't ambitious enough. Half complained that she wasn't forceful enough on racial justice issues, while the other half were upset that she did too little to court blue-collar whites, who are turned off by identity politics. In the end, the compromise she represented wasn't exciting enough, and she lost.

[^2]: TPP was among the most absurd criticisms of Clinton's platform. It was attacked not for its actual contents, but as a stand-in for the political establishment. Throughout the 20th century, trade agreements enjoyed broad support from politicians of both parties, as well as from economists -- there are circumstances where free trade is not ideal, but even in those cases, protectionism is worse. It remains to be seen what will happen if other Pacific Rim nations choose to enact [RCEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Comprehensive_Economic_Partnership) instead.

Donald Trump, on the other hand, sidestepped this issue by refusing to articulate his positions. He echoed iconic Republican talking points when convenient -- lower taxes, gun rights, abortion restrictions -- but became evasive when pressed for details. His signature issue, a wall on the Mexican border, is more bravado than policy. He won by leveraging his personality: he held huge rallies, picked fights on Twitter, and dominated the media coverage.

If we're surprised that the charismatic candidate beat the policy-focused candidate, we shouldn't be -- it happens every time. Obama's campaigns were built on his powerful oratory skills. GWB ran as the candidate you'd like to have a beer with. In the past four decades, 1988 is the only presidential election in which the winner (GHWB) could reasonably be described as "smart but boring."

In the modern era, it seems that Democrats are actually more reliant than Republicans on the charisma of their presidential candidates. JFK, Carter, Bill Clinton, and Obama were famously charismatic, and inspired high voter turnout. The same cannot be said of Mondale, Dukakis, Gore, and Kerry. Republican voters, on the other hand, seem almost ambivalent to their nominee: the Republican candidate has earned about the same number of votes in each of the past four elections: 62M in 2004, 60M in 2008, 61M in 2012, and 60M in 2016.
